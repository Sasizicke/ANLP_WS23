# Assignment 3

## Return

The **_return_** statement is (usually) at the end of a function and exits it, returning one (or more) values. It is therefore necessary that the entire calculation of the function has already been completed.

## Yield

The **_yield_** statement is usually located in so-called generator functions (in contrast to "normal" functions, generator functions create objects that are iterated over). Unlike the **_return_** statement, the **_yield_** statement passes one (or more) values after each iteration. It therefore calculates the values step by step.
